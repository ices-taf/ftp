In this video, we will be looking at the TAF workflow

[1:56]

Behind each of those folders (data, input, model, and output) there is an R
script that governs what takes place. So let's take a look at those scripts in
more detail.

[3:14]

So what we're going to be doing, for the rest of the video, is to go through the
actual analysis behind the 2015 ICES advice for North Sea spotted ray. The R
scripts can be found on Github.

[3:42]

So let's just dive into data.R

[5:54]

The next script that is run is input.R

[6:31]

The third script, model.R, runs the model

[7:44]

The output.R script is about extracting those results of interest

[8:13]

Finally, in the report.R, we're going to prepare plots and tables

[9:26]

In the R scripts, we've been using some commands that are outside of base R;
we've been using some ICES packages.

[10:57]

We also see, in the help page, some functions that we'll now take a look at, to
run the scripts. There are convenient functions for that as well: sourceTAF is
to run a single script and sourceAll is to run all of them.

[12:06]

So what we have learned in this video is about the overall TAF workflow
